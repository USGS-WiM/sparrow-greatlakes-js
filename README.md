# SPARROW Great Lakes Nutrient Loading

SPARROW is a modeling tool for the regional interpretation of water-quality monitoring data. The model relates in-stream water-quality measurements to spatially referenced characteristics of watersheds, including contaminant sources and factors influencing terrestrial and aquatic transport. SPARROW empirically estimates the origin and fate of contaminants in river networks and quantifies uncertainties in model predictions. This application provides a flexible viewer to visualise SPARROW watershed models.

This project is based on the USGS WiM Generator template for ESRI Javascript API web map applications.  To work with the code you will need the following software: 

[Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/)
[Git](https://desktop.github.com/)

```
Give examples
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

To begin clone the repository from Github to your development machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/USGS-WiM/sparrow-greatlakes-js.git
```

Change to the new newly created directory

```
cd sparrow-greatlakes-js
```

Install dependencies using NPM

```
npm install
```
## Building and testing

The application uses [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) as a build system.  You may need to install Gulp on your development machine.

```

To create a build run:
```
 gulp build
```
